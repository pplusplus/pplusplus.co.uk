The Direct Line Group is one of the UK's largest insurers. DLG approached wejo to create an app that could offer drivers cashback on  money they have spent in shops, I was part of a team of 3 developers and was instrumental in it's development; working with designers and back end teams to produce a quality product for the end user.
