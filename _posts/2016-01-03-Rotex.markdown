title:  "Rotex Sales Kit"

Rotex were looking for an app used to retrieve datasheets and other supporting information to aid sales staff in their efforts at trade shows. The idea of the app is fairly simple; consume and synchronise data exposed by a web api.

I was responsible for the implementation and support of this application.
