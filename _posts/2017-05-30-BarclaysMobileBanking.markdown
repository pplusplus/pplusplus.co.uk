Barclays Mobile Banking is one of the UK's best banking apps. I have facilitated and lead the development of a number of features in the application such as the homepage, business banking invoicing and spending analytics to name a few... In more recent times I have focussed my role on code quality, automation and providing technical direction for the project. I have reworked and improved number of existing CI/CD pipelines as well as implementing and deploying new jobs that promote good coding standards as well as the maintainance of the project. I am currently focused on the modularisation and restructuring of the project in order to promote a new way of working.
