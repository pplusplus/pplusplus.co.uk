Fragger.IO was an iOS multiplayer game developed as part of a university assignment. The gameplay is somewhere in between battleships, Pacman and minesweeper; dropping grenades are invisible to the enemy and vice versa. The damage inflicted on the opponent is directly proportional to the distance they are from the grenade blast, the first player to take a fatal amount of damage loses. This project was implemented over the course of approximately four weeks. 

Techologies used:
