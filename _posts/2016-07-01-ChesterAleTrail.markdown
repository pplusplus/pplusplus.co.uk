The Chester Ale Trail is a guide to help you find the best pubs in Chester in which to enjoy local ales. Complete the trail and collect a free pint! I was responsible for the implemenation and release of this app, the app utilitise bluetooth iBeacons to check into locations on the ale trail and subsequently earn the user a free pint.
