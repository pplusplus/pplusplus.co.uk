Hedcamz approached Footsqueek looking for a companion app to bundle with their affordable action camera: the Olfi Camera. Whilst I was provided with an SDK for the camera it proved to be extremely unstable and subsequently I was required to reverse engineer the SDK in order to create a new, stable and well-documented API.
