Hedcamz approached Footsqueek looking for a companion app to bundle with their affordable action camera: the Olfi Camera. 

I was responsible for the implementation and supporting this application. I was asked to integrate a third-party SDK for the camera however, it proved to be extremely unstable and subsequently I was required to reverse engineer the SDK in order to create a new, stable and well-documented API.
