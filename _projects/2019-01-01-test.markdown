This project was implemented over the course of approximately four weeks. The project requirements specified an iOS game, using Swift and the Sprite Kit framework, was to be developed. Ultimately it was decided that a multiplayer game was to be developed; by using Node.js and the Socket.io web socket framework it was possible to create bidirectional communication between the iOS client application and the Node.js server. The style of gameplay is somewhere in between battleships and Pacman, dropping grenades are invisible to the enemy and vice versa. The damage inflicted on the opponent is directly proportional to the distance they are from the grenade blast, the first player to take a fatal amount of damage loses.
